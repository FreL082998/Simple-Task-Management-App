## Short Description

This simple app allows users to manage tasks visually across columns such as **Backlog**, **Ready to Go**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. Tasks can be created, edited, deleted, and rearranged with drag-and-drop. The application ensures all operations persist to a backend API and the UI stays responsive and smooth.

## API Endpoints

Assuming a REST API backend, the endpoints used are:

| Method | Endpoint     | Description                                          |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/tasks`     | Fetch all tasks (paginated)                          |
| POST   | `/tasks`     | Create a new task                                    |
| PUT    | `/tasks/:id` | Update a task (title, description, status, position) |
| DELETE | `/tasks/:id` | Delete a task                                        |

**Sample Response for GET `/tasks`:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Test",
      "description": "test",
      "status": "Backlog",
      "position": 1,
      "created_at": "2025-09-16 23:23:51",
      "updated_at": "2025-09-16 23:23:51"
    }
  ],
